Here are test case suggestions for the user, accommodation, and booking tables. Each test case includes meaningful joins across tables to fulfill the tutor's requirements.

1. Test Case for User Table
Scenario: Retrieve a list of users along with the accommodations they booked and the booking cost.

Query:

SELECT
    u.Name AS GuestName,
    a.Description AS Accommodation,
    b.TotalCost AS BookingCost
FROM
    user u
JOIN
    booking b ON u.UserID = b.BookedByUserID
JOIN
    accommodation a ON b.AccommodationID = a.AccommodationID
ORDER BY
    b.TotalCost DESC;

Purpose:
- Tests the relationship between user, booking, and accommodation.
- Validates foreign keys: BookedByUserID in booking and AccommodationID in accommodation.

2. Test Case for Accommodation Table
Scenario: Retrieve details of accommodations, their hosts, and the total number of bookings per accommodation.

Query:

SELECT
    a.Description AS Accommodation,
    h.HostID AS Host,
    COUNT(b.BookingID) AS TotalBookings
FROM
    accommodation a
LEFT JOIN
    hostprofile h ON a.HostID = h.HostID
LEFT JOIN
    booking b ON a.AccommodationID = b.AccommodationID
GROUP BY
    a.AccommodationID
ORDER BY
    TotalBookings DESC;

Purpose:
- Tests the connection between accommodation, hostprofile, and booking.
- Validates the usage of HostID as a foreign key in accommodation and AccommodationID in booking.

3. Test Case for Booking Table
Scenario: Retrieve bookings made by guests, including guest names, check-in dates, and total costs.

Query:

SELECT
    g.GuestID,
    u.Name AS GuestName,
    b.CheckInDate,
    b.TotalCost
FROM
    booking b
JOIN
    guestprofile g ON b.GuestID = g.GuestID
JOIN
    user u ON b.BookedByUserID = u.UserID
WHERE
    b.TotalCost > 500
ORDER BY
    b.CheckInDate ASC;

Purpose:
- Tests the relationship between booking, guestprofile, and user.
- Validates foreign keys: GuestID in booking and BookedByUserID in user.
